# studyHTML
As part of my 100 days of code challenge I'll be going through the foundations.


These are the resources I used along the way:
  - Learn HTML | https://web.dev/learn/html
  - w3schools | https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp
  - Mozilla Developer Netword (MDN) | https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML
